This is a sample document text for testing the CRUD operations in the VectorDB.
It includes multiple lines of text to demonstrate the functionality.
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

Consider a text-based search system where documents are stored as vectors in a vector database. When a new document is added, it is first encoded into a vector using a Sentence Transformer model. This vector is then inserted into a FAISS index within the vector database.
When a user queries the system, the query is also encoded into a vector. The system performs a similarity search using FAISS to find the most similar document vectors in the database. The top N results are retrieved and presented to the user.
Periodically, documents may be updated to reflect new information or deleted if they are no longer relevant. These operations ensure that the vector database remains up-to-date and accurate.
Vector databases are a powerful tool for managing high-dimensional vector data, enabling efficient similarity search and data retrieval. By leveraging tools like FAISS and machine learning models for vectorization, vector databases support a wide range of applications in AI and data science.
